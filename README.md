# MedleyEdits

MedleyEdits is an innovative tool currently in development, designed to empower developers and educators by streamlining the creation of educational content, such as reels and shorts, with unparalleled ease. The project leverages the capabilities of React.js and Node.js to offer a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: MedleyEdits provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies the content creation process.

- **Screen and Camera Access**: The tool seamlessly integrates screen sharing and web camera access permissions to enhance the recording capabilities.

- **Dynamic Video Rendering**: Upon initiating recording, the backend dynamically renders a new video with dimensions optimized for a standard reel.
